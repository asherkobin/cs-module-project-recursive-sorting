# Module Project - Recursive Sorting

## Algorithms

## Recursive Sorting

## Objectives

- identify when a problem is amenable to a recursive solution and use recursion to solve it
- trace and accurately identify the output of a recursive function call
- write a recursive solution to a problem
- distinguish when to use, classify the performance, and implement code to conduct classic recursive sorting algorithms

## Introduction

During today's project, you will get a chance to practice the module's objectives. You will be required to write a recursive merge sort algorithm. Knowing when to and how to use recursion will make you a better programmer and developer. It will give you one more tool in your toolbag whenever you face a problem that you need to solve.

When you begin interviewing for jobs, you will often encounter problems that have elegant recursive solutions. Being comfortable with recursion and understanding how recursion works at a deep level is essential in ensuring you are ready to impress hiring managers and (ultimately) can contribute to an engineering team in a significant way.

## Instructions and/or completion requirements

1. Open up the [recursive_sorting](src/recursive_sorting) directory
2. Read through the descriptions of the `merge_sort` algorithm
3. Implement `merge_sort` in [recursive_sorting.py](src/recursive_sorting/recursive_sorting.py)
4. Test your implementation by running `test_recursive.py`

## Resources [TODO]

This section includes links to any required or supplemental materials. These may consist of documents an instructor or curriculum developer explicitly created for the course, or external references and examples and that relate to/inform/shed light on the module challenge.

## Stretch goals

- [ ] Implement all the methods in the `searching.py` file in the `searching` directory.
- [ ] Implement the `count_sort` algorithm in the `iterative_sorting` directory.
- [ ] Implement an in-place version of `merge_sort` that does not allocate any additional memory. In other words, the space complexity for this function should be O(1).
- [ ] Implement the `timsort` algorithm, which is a real-world sorting algorithm. It is the sorting algorithm that is used when you run Python's built-in `sort` method. 

## Tests [TODO]

Not every module (or every course) will require this section.

However, courses and modules with significant programming components may find it useful to include information/instruction regarding any code tests that the students may or may not be required to run to verify they've produced a passing solution.

If you include tests, describe how to run them, and any setup required. Be as detailed as possible â€“ testing is an area many of our students struggle with.

## FAQs [TODO]

**What should I include in this section?**

*Include the answers to frequently asked questions as they come up. If it's a new module challenge, try to answer a few of the questions you think students might ask. Think ahead to potential roadblocks for an amateur.*

## Submission format [TODO]

Describe how the student should deliver the completed challenge. If it's step-by-step,

1. include
2. a
3. numbered
4. list.

## Grading rubric [TODO]

If you've prepared a grading rubric to evaluate the quality of a student's work on your module challenge assignment, include any instructions or relevant links below.
